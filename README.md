# Template Repo for ML Project

This template repo will give you a good starting point for your second project. Besides the files used for creating a virtual environment, you will find a simple example of how to build a simple model in a python script. This is maybe the simplest way to do it. We train a simple model in the jupyter notebook, where we select only some features and do minimal cleaning. The output is then stored in simple python scripts.

The data used for this is: [coffee quality dataset](https://github.com/jldbc/coffee-quality-database).

## Project assignment and Kanban board

- The project brief, options, milestones, and deliverables are in [01_assignment.md](01_assignment.md).
- The step-by-step GitHub Kanban board setup is in [02_kanban_board.md](02_kanban_board.md).

## Set up your Environment



### **`macOS`** type the following commands : 

- For installing the virtual environment you can either use the [Makefile](Makefile) and run `make setup` or install it manually with the following commands:

     ```BASH
    make setup
    ```
    After that active your environment by following commands:
    ```BASH
    source .venv/bin/activate
    ```
Or ....
- Install the virtual environment and the required packages by following commands:

    ```BASH
    pyenv local 3.11.3
    python -m venv .venv
    source .venv/bin/activate
    pip install --upgrade pip
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```
    
### **`WindowsOS`** type the following commands :

- Install the virtual environment and the required packages by following commands.

   For `PowerShell` CLI :

    ```PowerShell
    pyenv local 3.11.3
    python -m venv .venv
    .venv\Scripts\Activate.ps1
    python -m pip install --upgrade pip
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

    For `Git-bash` CLI :
  
    ```BASH
    pyenv local 3.11.3
    python -m venv .venv
    source .venv/Scripts/activate
    python -m pip install --upgrade pip
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

    **`Note:`**
    If you encounter an error when trying to run `pip install --upgrade pip`, try using the following command:
    ```Bash
    python.exe -m pip install --upgrade pip
    ```


   
## Usage

In order to train the model and store test data in the data folder and the model in models run:

**`Note`**: Make sure your environment is activated.

```bash
python example_files/train.py  
```

In order to test that predict works on a test set you created run:

```bash
python example_files/predict.py models/linear_regression_model.sav data/X_test.csv data/y_test.csv
```

## Limitations

Development libraries are part of the production environment, normally these would be separate as the production code should be as slim as possible.

## Handling Merge Conflicts in Jupyter Notebooks

When working in teams, `.ipynb` files can cause messy merge conflicts because they’re JSON-based.  
We use **nbdime** to make this easy.

### Setup (run once)
```bash
nbdime config-git --enable
```

### When a conflict happens
```bash
nbdime mergetool
```

A web interface will open showing both notebook versions side by side.
Choose what to keep, save and close tool, then:
```bash
git add your_notebook.ipynb
git commit -m "Resolved notebook conflict"
```
That’s it — clean merges for notebooks!
